# Machine Learning for Programming

## Summary

*July 18-19, Oxford, UK*
Collocated with *FLoC 2018* (http://www.floc2018.org/)

The two-day event will feature invited and contributed talks
on improving software reliability and developer productivity
by using machine learning, including deep learning. The
techniques of interest include leveraging big code repositories
(such as github) to build models of code and using them for
program analysis, synthesis, and repair techniques that 
advance the state of the art.

## Call for papers

### Topics

The workshop accepts submissions of extended abstracts
that will be disseminated on the workshop web site.
We welcome applied and theoretical contributions exploring, among others:

* new learning algorithms, models, and architectures for the domain of programs;
* machine learning methods for program suggestion, synthesis, debugging, and other programming tasks;
* probabilistic extensions of conventional program analyses;
* source code representations for learning;
* applying natural language processing techniques to code, comments, documentation, and other software artifacts;
* description and evaluations of new tools;

### Format 

Well-prepared surveys and vision statements will also be considered.

The accepted extended abstracts will not preclude
subsequent publication in conferences or journals.  
Submitted papers should be most 5 pages in length
(excluding references and appendices) and be prepared
using the EPTCS style file available from:

http://style.eptcs.org/

Each accepted extended abstract must be presented by an author
at the workshop, 18-19 July 2018.
