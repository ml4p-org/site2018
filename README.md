# Machine Learning for Programming

## 18–19 July 2018, Oxford, UK

**Workshop affiliated to [CAV 2018](http://cavconference.org/2018/),
as part of [FLoC 2018](http://www.floc2018.org/).**

The two-day event will feature invited and contributed talks on improving
software reliability and developer productivity by using machine learning,
including deep learning. The techniques of interest include leveraging big code
repositories (such as GitHub) to build models of code and using them for
program analysis, synthesis, and repair techniques that advance the state of
the art.

## Call for papers

### Topics

The workshop accepts submissions of extended abstracts that will be
disseminated on the workshop web site. We welcome applied and theoretical
contributions exploring, among others:

* new learning algorithms, models, and architectures for the domain of programs;
* machine learning methods for program suggestion, synthesis, debugging, and other programming tasks;
* probabilistic extensions of conventional program analyses;
* source code representations for learning;
* applying natural language processing techniques to code, comments, documentation, and other software artifacts;
* description and evaluations of new tools.

### Format

The accepted extended abstracts will not preclude subsequent publication in
conferences or journals. Submitted papers should be most 5 pages in length
(excluding references and appendices) and be prepared using [the EPTCS style
file](http://style.eptcs.org/). We will consider original research contributions
as well well-prepared surveys and vision statements.

Each accepted extended abstract must be presented by an author at the workshop,
18-19 July 2018.
